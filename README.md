# WebXRBabylonIO

# About

This project is about the development of a cooperative multiplayer VR-Game using webXR.
The server runs with Socket.IO and the 3D-Representation is done in Babylonjs.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and git Bash installed, to run the project.
Node.js is requiered to run the server and git Bash ist used to create the ssl certrificates needed for https.

## Set up

Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felixChB/WebXRBabylonIO.git
```
### Create ssl certificates and keys for https

1. create a folder called sslcerts in the main folder of the repository
2. open git bash
3. in git bash navigate to the main folder
4. to create the self-signed certificate and key, run the following command:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout sslcerts/selfsigned.key -out sslcerts/selfsigned.cert
```

### Install dependencies

Open the main folder of the repository in a coding software (e.x. Visual Studio Code) and open the terminal.
To install all required dependencies, type:
```bash
npm install
```
It should create a folder called node_modules with all dependencies.

## Starting the Server

To start the application, the `ipAdress` variable in the `server.js` file has to be changed to your individual ip adress.
Type the following in the terminal to build the bundle.js file:
```bash
npm run build
```
After that type the following to start the server and the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the https server on your ip Adress on port 3000.
It will also start webpack in watch mode and nodemon to watch for file changes and pack and restart the server accordingly.
